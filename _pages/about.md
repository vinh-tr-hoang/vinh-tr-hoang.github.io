I'm developing numerical methods for data assimilation and uncertainty quantification particularly for applications in environmental/weather forecast and material science. 


Currently, I’m working as a postdoctoral researcher at the Chair of Mathematics for Uncertainty Quantification, Department of Mathematics, at the RWTH Aachen University,
Germany. 
I acquired PhD degree in applied sciences at University of Li\`{e}ge in Belgium and was a postdoctoral researcher at the nstitute of Scientific Computing, Technische Universität Braunschweig, Germany.
