# About
Hi, I’m Truong-Vinh Hoang,
a researcher in the domain of scientific computing.

Currently, I’m working as a postdoctoral researcher at the Chair of Mathematics for Uncertainty Quantification, Department of Mathematics, at the RWTH Aachen University,
Germany. 

My works deal with computational models for engineering problems. 
Thanks to scientific and teaching activities I acquired experiences in machine learning, probability, uncertainty quantification, data sciences, 
model order reduction methods, and computational physics.
A research topic is to solve inverse problems using deep learning techniques, e.g. using artificial  neural network to build non-linear filters 
for data assimilation problems. 
Another topic that I investigated is the parameter identification problem in the context of random set theory. 

Prior to that I acquired PhD degree in applied sciences at University of Liege in Belgium and was a postdoctoral researcher at the nstitute of Scientific Computing, Technische Universität Braunschweig, Germany. 
My PhD thesis focuses on the uncertainty quantification of adhesion behaviors at micro-scale of micro-nano devices.
